      <h2>About the Oman Railway Multimedia Project</h2>

      <p>
        The <strong>Oman Railway Multimedia Project</strong> was created as part of the GIS6009 Advanced Multimedia coursework. 
        The aim of this project is to design and develop a complete multimedia web experience that visually and interactively communicates the theme of 
        <em>“Oman Railway – Connecting Oman Through Innovation.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        This project integrates multiple forms of media including <strong>image editing, video production, audio editing, and 3D animation</strong>. 
        Each component contributes to a unified storytelling experience that showcases the technological progress and infrastructure development of Oman’s railway system.
      </p>

      <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>To apply multimedia tools and design principles to develop a professional web-based project.</li>
        <li>To demonstrate creative and technical skills in image, video, audio, and 3D content creation.</li>
        <li>To represent the modernization and connectivity of Oman’s railway system through digital media.</li>
        <li>To build an interactive and responsive multimedia website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tools and Software Used</h3>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> – for image editing, enhancement, and color correction.</li>
        <li><strong>CapCut Desktop</strong> – for professional video editing, transitions, and motion effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Adobe Audition</strong> – for sound design, noise reduction, and audio enhancement.</li>
        <li><strong>Adobe After Effects</strong> – for creating 3D animation and visual motion graphics.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</strong> – for integrating all multimedia elements into a cohesive and interactive web interface.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Project Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The Oman Railway Multimedia Website is divided into six main phases:
      </p>
      <ol class="about-list">
        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Website Planning and Layout Design</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Image Editing and Gallery Development</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Video Editing and Integration</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Audio Design and Embedding</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> 3D Animation and Presentation</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 6:</strong> Evaluation and Reflection</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Each phase builds upon the previous one, combining visual design, technical execution, and multimedia integration to form a cohesive final product.
      </p>

      <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Through the Oman Railway Multimedia Project, I developed a strong understanding of multimedia production workflows, including digital editing, 
        audio-visual synchronization, and responsive web design. 
        This project also enhanced my ability to use industry-standard software and apply creative decision-making to achieve professional results.
